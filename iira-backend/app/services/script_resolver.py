    """
    Resolves the LLM's planned tools to actual, available scripts.

    This function iterates through each step of the LLM's plan and attempts to
    find the most relevant script from the provided list.

    Args:
        llm_plan (dict): The structured plan from the LLM, containing steps
                         with 'description' and 'tool' names.
        available_scripts (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
                                  represents an available script from the database.
                                  Example: {'id': '1', 'name': 'restart_web_server', ...}

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries representing the resolved workflow.
              Each dictionary contains the original step description and the
              details of the best-matched script.
