Title: High CPU Usage Due to Unknown Process

Issue:
System reports sustained high CPU usage, and users are experiencing performance degradation.

Resolution Steps:

1. Identify top CPU-consuming process.
Script: get_top_process
Parameters:

metric: cpu

limit: 1
Output: Returns process_id (PID) of the top CPU-hogging process.

2. Fetch process details for identified PID (from step 1).
Script: get_process_details
Parameters:

pid: {output.process_id from step 1}
Output: Returns process_name, user, cmdline.

3. Check if process is a known safe service or a rogue process.
Script: verify_process_legitimacy
Parameters:

process_name: {output.process_name from step 2}

user: {output.user from step 2}
Output: Returns status (safe/rogue).

4. If rogue, terminate the process.
Script: kill_process
Parameters:

pid: {output.process_id from step 1}

signal: 9

5. Verify CPU usage has returned to normal.
Script: check_cpu_usage
Parameters:

threshold: 80

Notes:

If the process is a critical service (like postgres or nginx), validate before killing.

Capture logs before terminating for audit purposes.
